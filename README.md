# banoogle

Banoogle adds `!bang` searches to Google! To use, simply set

```
banoogle.com/search?q=%s
```

as your default search engine! Test it out with `!gh banoogle`. At the moment, the list of bangs are taken from [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/bang).

## Motivation

I'm going to start by saying, I hate that I made this thing... I don't like the monopoly Google has, and I would hate to contribute to it. I love what Kagi and DuckDuckGo are doing to re-think search engines and promote privacy! Unfortunately, I've tried to use DuckDuckGo and then Kagi for a long time, and right now, given their performance, stability and search results, I don't find them to be very useful on a day to day basis. If you find them to be useful, I would highly suggest you keep using and supporting them!

However, after using DuckDuckGo and Kagi, I find having bangs to be indispensable, so I built this thing to simply preprocess my queries. Save a couple clicks, and send a little less data to Google!
